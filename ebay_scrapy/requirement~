*Price ;  depending on the type of action it could have 2 prices .
1.If it is a Buy it Now Action it only was one price
But depending on quantity we can see if the action was a success or not . Also  if it was a success and the quantity was larger then 1 how many items where sold?
To see all of this details you must do a little research in  how  ebay is working – I tr
2. If it is a action we are interested in :
- Action Duration
- No of bids
- The winning bid sum
-> you can get all of this info if you visit the link of the product after the item action was closed :
Ex : http://offer.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewBids&item=281942984328&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2565
Note : the crawler should run auto and find new products as they are added
Final Note: we are interested to see if the product was sold or not , at what price , how many pics they sold
